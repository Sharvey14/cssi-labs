<p>God of War is a methodical reimagining of the action franchise. Rather than ignoring its past with a top-to-bottom reboot, God of War is a sequel that's in dialogue with both the actions of its characters and its previous creators. But plenty has been said about where the entry fits alongside its predecessors. Mentioned less is how well God of War stands on its own, working just fine without the baggage of its prequels. You get the sense, a couple dozen hours into the adventure, that it was created by massive fans of all sorts of other games: The campaign takes inspiration from the Tomb Raider and Doom reboots, Dark Souls, Shadow of the Colossus and even Call of Duty - the widely praised ax throwing combat, for example, places a first-person shooter reticle within a third-person action game, creating something unique and fresh.</p>


<li><strong>Return Of The Obra Dinn</strong></li>

<p>Return of the Obra Dinn is a detailed, unique and beautiful murder mystery from Lucas Pope, the maker of Papers, Please. Drawn in retro monochrome, it's set aboard an abandoned ship in 1807. The player is an insurance agent tasked with investigating the ship, seeking clues to the deaths and disappearances of its crew. By a process of elimination, the agent pieces together the tale of a torrid voyage. It's a highly original cross between an old-fashioned novel and a narrative sudoku puzzle, in which facts and events are pieced together to present a satisfying whole. Pope's game is a masterpiece in detail, style and story.</p>

<li><strong>Florence</strong></li>

<p>Florence is a universal love story tastefully spiced with complicated emotions. It doesn't need a huge budget or uncanny valley motion capture. Instead, its message benefits from humble story beats and playful interactions. Florence is a game about love in all its varieties and degrees. It portrays the awkwardness of first dates, how two people can ease into each other's lives. It shows the hills and valleys of a relationship with a critical but caring parent. It also captures the feeling of being a 20-something and feeling (despite all evidence to the contrary) that you are stuck on a path, like a parcel on conveyor belt carrying you to a predetermined destination. Its greatest strength might be its minimal text. You assemble dialogue bubbles from puzzle pieces in conversations between Florence and her boyfriend Krish. When they get along, the bubbles may be only one or two pieces. When they fight, the bubbles fragment and the pieces become more jagged, the colors more intense. It's evocative, but also engaging. The player is both a voyeur and a participant; this is both Florence's story and our own.</p>

<li><strong>Tetris Effect</strong></li>

<p>For the past three decades, people have zoned out with the help of Tetris. The classic, nigh-perfect puzzle game demands unwavering attention, particularly at higher speeds. To excel at Tetris is to tune out the rest of the world. Gazing upon a desert sunset, walking through pristine snow and chilling with dolphins are so sensually rich on their own, it's easy to overlook the simple fact that Tetris Effect is also a damn good puzzle game. Its additions ultimately don't distract from the game; they complement it, reminding us what an addictive, pleasurable and transportive experience a game of Tetris can be.</p>

<li><strong>Celeste</strong></li>

<p>Matt Thorson's follow-up to TowerFall takes one move from the competitive multiplayer game (its buoyant jump) and mines it for every fleck of creativity, like a chef creating a prix fixe menu around a single, delicious and flexible ingredient. Celeste is a challenging platformer, in the line of Mario or Meat Boy, but notably, it includes tools to modify and alleviate the difficulty. You can slow the game speed, turn on invincibility or skip chapters. Thorson's game doesn't judge players for how they experience his work. And for those who want a more difficult experience, collectible strawberries are tucked throughout the world of Celeste, typically in precarious places, provoking highly skilled players to pursue challenge for no greater reason than "it's fun." The decision to trim the stress from a notoriously stressful genre pairs well with Celeste's story, which plunges into the shadowy trauma of anxiety, depression and meeting the expectations of those we love most. A charming art style and an uplifting score hold everything together, like a warm sweater or a bear hug. Life is hard enough, Celeste seems to say, there's nothing wrong in asking for help.</p>

<li><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong></li>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mpUwElAFzp-UbNpLWCVkyTha5QY=/0x0:3840x1521/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x1521):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13438479/Red_Dead_Redemption_2_bone_locations_cover.png">
<p>Rockstar's notorious satire has been replaced with a straightforward ensemble piece for Red Dead Redemption 2, and the previous game's Southwest setting swapped out for the American South, blurring the story's genre between Western and historical drama. It's still a power fantasy, but the developers often toy with players assumptions. When I find myself horseless in the mountains, for example, I discover it will be a very long and dull walk home - one I probably won't survive, what with all the criminals and deadly critters. The game is slower, stranger and, for better and worse, more confident in its storytelling, an ambitious albeit flawed exploration of life in the American South following the Civil War. At its best, it feels like a novel - a patient, cohesive, sweeping trip in another person's boots.</p>

<li><strong>Into The Breach</strong></li>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzaiGsBwAA79jfnM3DN2FK0VyjM=/0x0:1280x720/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1280x720):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10300469/itb_1.jpg">
<p>Into the Breach would feel like a Nintendo game, were it not so fascinated with the death of human civilization at the hands (claws? maws?) of grotesque aliens. Similarly to what Nintendo has done with so many genres, creators Justin Ma and Matthew Davis distill a complex strategy formula into an approachable, forgiving idea that feels almost like a classic board game. That isn't to say Into the Breach is easy - it isn't! Rather, it's fair, taking time to teach you rules, presenting them clearly within the world's design, then testing you to see what you learn and how you adapt.</p>

<li><strong>Monster Hunter: World</strong></li>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NydPsQmRlewnCTRJJZQwNSr3IIM=/0x0:1772x998/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1772x998):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9593819/Screen_Shot_2017_11_01_at_6.03.40_PM.png">
<p>Here's Polygon's Chelsea Stark laying out everything you need to know about Monster Hunter: World: "To answer the three most pressing questions around Monster Hunter: World: Yes, its creators have made a notoriously inaccessible franchise into something that, if not totally accessible, somewhat resembles it. Yes, it's still filled with countless menus and tough-to-parse mythos. And yes, this game lets you be best friends with a cat." There's a BFF cat - what else can I add that might convince you to give Monster Hunter: World a try? You demand more? For fans of Capcom games who haven't leapt into this daunting franchise, Monster Hunter: World carries a bounty of goofy cameos. The game has received post-launch updates featuring characters from Street Fighter, Devil May Cry and Mega Man. For non-Capcom fans, the guest stars complement the abundance of other additions, from new quests to humongous beasts. Monster Hunter: World was a great game at release. With each month, it's only gotten better.</p>

<li><strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong></li>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArLtszX7kgZOp38SRvoyXTrSyIA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12882689/Marvel_s_Spider_Man_20180908184811.jpg">
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man achieves something rare among licensed games: it goes toe-to-toe with its lead character's two blockbuster movies this year in terms of quality, while not directly tying into either. The PS4 exclusive takes inspiration from Spider-Man's significant history in comic books, movies, television shows and games, but established canon doesn't prevent the writers from taking their own risks. Sure, the plot's a little predictable, and yet while I could predict each beat, so little of the final experience felt rote or uninspired. It does just enough to subvert expectations, while also providing the opportunity to zip around a world so familiar and established.</p>

<li><strong>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</strong></li>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLMVWUVqNREyybyl8a4l12geDVs=/0x0:3840x2160/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13186133/ofewauwsnqfcvar9fcho.jpg">
<p>Exploration, combat, stealth, role-playing progression and dialogue choice make up the core activities in this giant open world, but its kinetic elements don't entirely do it justice. Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a teeming saga of the Peloponnesian War, loaded with likable, believable characters, both fictional and drawn from history. Moody marine hues and bright Hellenic contrasts create an eye-pleasing world of mountains, meadows, cities and islands. The story twists a warm familial reunion narrative with a cold, hard search for vengeance against an evil cult. Hidden shipwrecks, mythical beasts, combat arenas and creepy tombs add to a sense of a fantastical, expansive world. Ubisoft built the Assassin's Creed series on its big, dense open worlds. But Odyssey's world feels like a turning point, loosening its focus on muted historical settings seen from grimny rooftops, and instead embracing vibrant colors, mythological beasts, and sprawling swaths of ocean and countryside.</p>
